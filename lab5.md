# Lab Report 5 - Putting it All Together

## Part 1 â€“ Debugging Scenario
Student: I have my ```grade.sh``` bash script written but it doesn't work as I expected. Here is my screenshot for ```grade.sh```. 
![]()

TA: It seems like your logic of checking whether failures occur during the test has some flaws. Could you try cd to the grading area, after you ran your bash script?
     
Student: Yes, I noticed that there is a 


## Part 2 - Reflection
The most significant takeaway from the second half of labs for cse15L is about processor. Java processor is the medium to for the communication between the program and the terminal. By integrating bash commands with java programs, now I can write an autograder just like Gradescope. It is done by breaking down the grading process into steps of re-directing outputs or errors, then my program can analyze these outputs. After this, I learnt how to edit codes from command line and push to the github just like how to contribute toward a tech-company's repository in real life. One thing I found impressive is using jdb command to stop the program at certain breakpoint, so I can keep track of how variables update through the process.
